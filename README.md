#Looking over our implementation/ Compilation

For compilation we recommend downloading the latest version of unity from this link
https://store.unity.com/download?ref=personal

Download the unity hub and then from the hub you can select the version we used for the project
-(Unity 2019.2.15) ** Downloading older version may cause errors

Once downloaded you can add our project folder

Then inside the editor assets and components used in our game can be viewed/edited/compiled (File>Build and Run)

**Warning since our game uses multiple scenes it can not be played in the editor. 
It needs to be built and ran
